This project is a moc website for a small coffee shop in downtown Franklin!
The site provides:  1. Details on the current menu, with pictures
                    2. A mock online ordering form, with an order confirmation page
                    3. A page to apply for a job as a barista
This project was created with .html and .css
Five ways I could improve this site are:
                    1. Including a mock location for the coffee shop
                    2. Payment options other than paying in store
                    3. More realistic fields for the mock job application
                    4. More interactive photos and buttons
                    5. More realistically sized menu
